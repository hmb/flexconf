.SH NAME

flexconf \- C++ header file preprocessor for generating xml configurations



.SH SYNOPSIS

.B flexconf
headerfile [headerfile...]



.SH DESCRIPTION

.B flexconf
is a preprocessor that reads your native header files and generates
a simple lightweight XML parser tailored to your custom C++ configuration
structures. It uses the same nesting in the XML file that is defined
by your C++ structures.
.B flexconf
already provides support for C++ inbuild types and the
commonly used STL classes
.I string
,
.I list
,
.I map
and
.I set.
It can easily be extended, by writing custom serializers for new types.
.PP
The preprocessor output is a minimal set of source files that
\- like the approach used in lexx/yacc \- are linked direcly to your
program. You don't need large libs with a lot of functionality you
never use. You can redistribute the generated files to enable people
to build your program from source without the need of installing the
.B flexconf
binary.



.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
process your header file configuration.h:

flexconf configuration.h



.SH BACKGROUND

Today many programs use XML configuration files. To access your configuration
from within a project you can either store your config values in a
key/value pair list or keep them nicely in standard C++ structures with
direct access to it's members.
.PP
The structure approach has several benefits over the key/value pairs:
.IP \-
The compiler checks for syntax errors avoiding mistyping of key names.
.IP \-
Strong typing avoids errors and conversion overhead.
.IP \-
A direct access to a member is faster than a lookup in a sorted list,
especially for big configurations.
.IP \-
The configuration's structure is kept througout the program.
.PP
On the other hand you pay for it with the additional work of reading
the configuration into your structure.
.PP
Using one of the standard xml parsers like
.I libxml
for reading an XML
configuration into a C++ structure often results in tedious rewriting of
the same code for every new XML configuration. You either have to use
a SAX parser with the task of generating some kind of status machine to
fill your structure or you'll find yourself walking through a full featured
XML document tree by hand. In any case you have to mirror your
configuration structure in code at least once. Both approches need a deep
inside knowledge of the used XML parser.
.PP
This is where flexconf steps in and automates the generation of the XML
parser from the very source where you define your configuration.
.B flexconf
uses a
.I flex
/
.I bison
parser combination to preprocess your header files.
It then generates the sourcecode for reading and writing the xml config
file, allowing yourself to focus on the original task of writing your
program.



.SH SERIALIZER / DESERIALIZER

.B flexconf
works as a preprocessor taking your input files and generating
two overloaded C++ functions
.I serialize
and
.I deserialize
for every C++ structure in the input files. It generates three output files
.I struct.h,
.I strucSer.cpp
and
.I structDes.cpp
containing those function prototypes and implementations.
.PP
The serializer
and deserializer take the object to de/serialize and the de/serialization
target as parameters. The target could be a file, a string, a pipe or
anything that has been derived from the taget base classes
.I CWriteXml
and
.I CReadXml.
See
.B TARGETS
for more information.
.PP
The generic prototypes for the serializer and deserializer functions are
as follows:

    void serialize(CWriteXml & rWriteXml, const SData & rObject);

    void deserialize(CReadXml & rReadXml, SData & rObject);

The second parameter is a const reference to the object to be serialized.
In case of the deserializer the reference is nonconst of course. The function
calls the de/serialize overload on every member of the structure, all of
which are either generated or provided by
.B flexconf
itself.
The functions do have more default parameters, that are used internally
and that are not explained in the scope of this manpage.



.SH XML TRANSLATION

The XML used by the de/serializer encapsulates every member of a structure
in XML tags corresponding to the name of the member.
For example the following structure:

    struct Person
    {
      std::string   Name;
      int           Age;
    };

is translated into:

    <Person>
      <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
      <Age>21</Age>
    </Person>

While this is sufficient for simple projects more control of the generation
process is given by the
.I flexconf comment tags.
See the section on
.B FINETUNIG
for more details.
.PP
Nested structures are expanded recursively just like the following:

    struct Couple
    {
      Person  Husband;
      Person  Wife;
    };

is translated into:

    <Couple>

      <Husband>
        <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
        <Age>21</Age>
      </Husband>

      <Wife>
        <Name>Jane Doe</Name>
        <Age>20</Age>
      </Wife>

    </Couple>

The blank lines are inserted for readability. As you can see the XML tags for
the nested
.I Person
are defined by the name of the member within the enclosing parent structure
and not by the name of the structure itself.
.PP
All basic language types are covered by the internal de/serializers, as
well as the STL
.I string
class which does not need special handling. When it comes to the STL
.I set, list, map
containers the above mechanism is not sufficient.
For those types
.B flexconf
generates de/serializers that de/serialize every element of the container.
For
.I set
and
.I list
this results in the writing the same structure once for every element in
the container.
The single elements are encapsulated in the
.I _item
tag.

    struct AddressBook
    {
      std::list<Person>   PersonList;
    };

is translated into:

    <AddressBook>
      <PersonList>

        <_item>
          <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
          <Age>21</Age>
        </_item>

        <_item>
          <Name>Jane Doe</Name>
          <Age>20</Age>
        </_item>
          ...
      </PersonList>
    </AddressBook>

The blank lines are again inserted for readability. The same applies
to the STL class
.I set.
.PP
The map however is trickier. As the
.I stl::map
element contains a value and an additional key, both have to be reflected
in the XML produced by
.B flexconf.
To simplify the XML design and to get a more natural representation of the
element, the map key is inserted into the element structure. This is what
the config file writer would expect: the key is simply one of the
tags included in the listed element structure.
To stress the config file point of view we show the example the other
way this time.
Let's say we have the above
.I Person
with an additional unique id, a e.g social security number.
We would expect the XML to look like this:

    <AddressBook>
      <PersonMap>

        <_item>
          <_id>12345</_id>
          <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
          <Age>21</Age>
        </_item>

        <_item>
          <_id>67890</_id>
          <Name>Jane Doe</Name>
          <Age>20</Age>
        </_item>
          ...
      </PersonMap>
    </AddressBook>

When deserializing
.B flexconf
takes the value of the
.I _id
tag and uses it as a key to insert a
.I Person
structure as defined above into the map. Ergo the declaration looks like this:

    struct Person
    {
      std::string   Name;
      int           Age;
    };

    struct AddressBook
    {
      std::map<std::string, Person>   PersonMap;
    };

As you see, the
.I _id
tag is missing in the
.I Person
structure, instead it is used as the key when inserting the element into the map.
Programmatically you will use the
.I stl::map::iterator
to access the complete structure. Then you can get the key by the iterators
.I first
member while the
.I Person
struct is the iterators
.I second
member:

    std::map<std::string, Person>::iterator itr = PersonMap.begin();
    std::string   & strKey      = itr->first;
    Person        & perElement  = itr->second;

This way we don't duplicate information, by inserting the key into the
.I Person
structure as well as into the map key.



.SH FINETUNIG

While the xml translation above provides all you need for XML config files
it is still desirable to disconnect the names used in structures from
those used in the XML files. Ususally you have some kind of prefixing,
indicating the type of a member, that's not necessarily desired in
the XML file. Or you might want to keep your xml tags all uppercase
which conflicts with your C++ naming policy.
.B flexconf
directives are used to control the way the XML is generated and read.
A directve is introduced by the
.I // flexconf
C++ comment.
The most important and probably mostly used directive is the alias directive.
It controls the name that is given to the XML element.
The alias of a complete structure has to precede the structure declaration.
Member aliases have to follow the member declaration.
.PP
The above declaration extended with type prefixes for the structure members
will still result in the same XML because the use of the alias directives.

    // flexconf alias Person
    struct SPerson
    {
      std::string   strName;    // flexconf alias Name
      int           nAge;       // flexconf alias Age
    };

is translated into

    <Person>
      <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
      <Age>21</Age>
    </Person>

When translating
.I set, list
and
.I map
elements you can replace the inbuild
.I _item
and
.I _id
tags with custom tags by using the
.I item
and
.I id
directves:

  struct AddressBook
  {
    std::list<SPerson>  lstPersonList;    // flexconf alias PERSON_LIST item PERSON
  };

becomes:

    <AddressBook>
      <PERSON_LIST>

        <PERSON>
          <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
          <Age>21</Age>
        </PERSON>

        <PERSON>
          <Name>Jane Doe</Name>
          <Age>20</Age>
        </PERSON>
            ...
      </PERSON_LIST>
    </AddressBook>

Here the example for the
.I map
using all three directives:

    struct AddressBook
    {
      std::map<SPerson>  mapPerson; // flexconf alias PERSON_LIST item PERSON id SOCIALSEC_NUMBER
    };

becomes:

    <AddressBook>
      <PERSON_LIST>

        <PERSON>
          <SOCIALSEC_NUMBER>12345</SOCIALSEC_NUMBER>
          <Name>Joe Doe</Name>
          <Age>21</Age>
        </PERSON>

        <PERSON>
          <SOCIALSEC_NUMBER>67890</SOCIALSEC_NUMBER>
          <Name>Jane Doe</Name>
          <Age>20</Age>
        </PERSON>
            ...
      </PERSON_LIST>
    </AddressBook>



.SH SKIPPING SECTIONS

The parser
.B flexconf
uses to parse the C++ header file knows the C++ syntax to some extent,
but it is by no means a fully grown C++ parser. Although it does
know and skips comments and member functions it might stumble over more
sophisticated C++ constructs. So your usual approach is to keep your
configuration structures in a separate file and process just that file
with
.B flexconf.
In some rare cases, when it is necessary that you keep C++ in you file
.B flexconf
does not understand, you can use the
.I skip directive
to skip those sections. The
.I skip directive
comes in three forms, all of which are equal:

the normal comment form, which may also be used to comment out something
in a single line:

    /* flexconf skip begin */
    //...
    // some non flexconf conform C++
    //...
    /* flexconf skip end */


the C++ style comment form:

    // flexconf skip begin
    //...
    // some non flexconf conform C++
    //...
    // flexconf skip end


the xml style comment form:

    //<!--
    //...
    // some non flexconf conform C++
    //...
    //-->

Although probably not very readable and recommendable you could even mix the
different beginning and ending tags.

Of course the skip directives could also be used to skip the generation of
de/serializers for structures that are contained in you header file but
not used in the configuration.



.SH TARGETS

When serializing or deserializing XML we need a target to write to or a
source to read from.
.B flexconf
provides two abstract baseclasses that have to be implemented and given
to the de/serializers as first parameter. Two default implementations
are provided by
.B flexconf
that provide reading from either a
.I std::string
or a file respectively. The classes are
.I CReadXmlPChar
and
.I CReadXmlFile.
We show the usage of the classes with a short example:

    const char      * pszSomeXml[]  = "...put valid xml here...";
    CReadXmlPChar     readPChar(pszSomeXml);
    SPerson           datPerson;

    deserialize(readPChar, datPerson);

You pass a char pointer to the xml used to the c'tor of the reader object.
Then you just pass the reader to the deserialize function.
When deserializing a file the syntax is a little different:

    CReadXmlFile      readFile;
    SPerson           datPerson;

    if (readFile.UseFile("somefilename.xml"))
    {
      deserialize(readFile, datPerson);
    }


Writing to a
.I std::string
is provided by the
.I CWriteXmlString
class. Again a small example of the usage:

    std::string       strXmlWrite;
    CWriteXmlString   writeString(strXmlWrite);
    SPerson           datPerson;

    serialize(writeString, datPerson);
    std::cout << strXmlWrite << std::endl;

You declare a string and provide it to the writer in its' constructor.
Then you just give the writer object to the serialize function.



.SH EXIT STATUS

.B flexconf
returns a zero exist status if it succeeds to parse the header file.
Non zero is returned in case of failure.
